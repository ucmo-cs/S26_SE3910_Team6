# IMPORTANT: With the default "from" (onboarding@resend.dev), Resend only delivers
# to the email address on your Resend account. To send to any customer email you must:
# 1. Add and verify a domain at https://resend.com/domains
# 2. Set RESEND_FROM to an address at that domain, e.g.:
# RESEND_FROM=Appointments <appointments@yourdomain.com>
